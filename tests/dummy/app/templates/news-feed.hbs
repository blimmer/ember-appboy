  The Appboy News Feed should work out of the box with Ember. With 0.1.0, you'll
  need to toggle the feed manually. Future versions will support this out of the
  box.

  **Disclaimer**: I am not using this feature currently, so your mileage may vary.
  If you are using this feature with ember-appboy, please update
  [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/blimmer/ember-appboy/issues/5) with
  any relevant information.
